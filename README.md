# Dashboard

Table of Contents Here

## What is this project?

I've had this idea for a while to create a dashboard that would help me manage my day. One card I want for my dashboard is a Pomodoro timer. I've been using the Pomofocus website for a while now, but I wanted to have my own version that works in a slightly different way.  I want to see how far I can get and how long it takes me to build this. I'm also going to use this to learn more about Rails 8, Hotwire, and Stimulus, as well as make a PWA.
